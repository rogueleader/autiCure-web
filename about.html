					<span>Autism is a developmental disability that impacts the normal development of the brain in the areas of social interaction and communication skills. Autism is a difficult thing to understand. One person with autism may have very different symptoms and behavioral characteristics than another. Because of these vast differences, doctors now think of autism as a "spectrum" disorder, in other words as a group of disorders with a range of similar features. Because of this, autism is now often called autism spectrum disorder (ASD).

                           Autism occurs in 5 out of 10,000 live births. 
                           Autism has been estimated to effect as high as 1/4% to 1/2% of the population. 

*These estimates include those with autism, Asperger syndrome, and PDD

					<br><h2>AUTISM IN INDIA </h2><br><p>

Due to lack of basic equipment and improper diagnosis of autism, the disorder is growing in India which now has over 10 million cases. Experts say early detection of this incurable disease can help a child lead his full potential but many medical professionals are unable to detect the disorder.
India is home to about 10 million people with autism and the disability has shown an increase over the last few years. According to statistics by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), one in every 88 children today is born with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) against a ratio of one in 110 few years back</p>
